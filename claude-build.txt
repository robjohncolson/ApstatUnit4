Task: Convert AP Statistics Unit 1 website to Unit 4
Essential files:
index.html: Main website to update - REPLACE all Unit 1 references with Unit 4
urls-map.md: Contains all Unit 4 video links - USE this for video URLs
pdf-map.txt: Maps Unit 4 PDF filenames - USE for filename references
Key actions (in priority order):
Change all Unit 1 text references to Unit 4 throughout index.html
Update exam weight from 15-23% to 10-20%
Update PDF paths from pdfs/unit1/1.X_quiz.pdf to pdfs/unit4/4.X_quiz.pdf
Replace video links using exact URLs from urls-map.md
Update the capstone section to include four parts (FRQ and MCQ parts A, B, C)
Important notes:
All PDF files ALREADY exist in pdfs/unit4/ directory
MAINTAIN all existing functionality - only change content
Unit 4 title: "Probability, Random Variables, and Probability Distributions"
