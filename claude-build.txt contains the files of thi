@ls-output.txt contains the files of this project.

This project is a website and @index-example.html is for Unit 1.@Index-example-spec.json tells youw how this website is structured.

Overall, jsut leave all things the same, they work well!

But, it's the study materials that need to be completely filled with.. new.. unit-appropriate material. 

The material are URLs to videos@urls-map.md , and links to PDF's@pdf-map.txt..

Check out@knowledge-tree.md for more context on the material itself. 

Again, the website I'm giving you is for unit 1, and I want your help to adapt it to Unit 4.
